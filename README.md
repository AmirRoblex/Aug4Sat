# Aug4Sat 🛰️

**AI-Powered Synthetic Satellite Imagery Generation**

Aug4Sat is an advanced tool for generating synthetic satellite imagery using AI-driven techniques. This application provides an intuitive interface for creating customized satellite images with precise control over land cover types, urban features, and environmental elements.

## 🌍 Overview

Aug4Sat leverages artificial intelligence to generate realistic satellite imagery based on user-defined parameters. Whether you need training data for machine learning models, urban planning visualizations, or environmental monitoring simulations, Aug4Sat provides a flexible solution for creating synthetic satellite datasets.

## ✨ Features

### Land Cover Control
- **Water Bodies**: Configure rivers, lakes, coastal areas, and ponds
- **Vegetation**: Control forest density, sparse trees, grasslands, and agricultural fields
- **Infrastructure**: Manage paved roads, unpaved roads, and highway networks
- **Urban Development**: Define residential, commercial, and industrial zones

### Generation Parameters
- **Customizable Resolution**: Generate images at your desired dimensions
- **Batch Processing**: Create multiple images in a single run
- **Scene Variety**: Control landscape diversity and density
- **Advanced Settings**: Fine-tune generation with steps, guidance scale, and seed control
- **Negative Prompts**: Specify elements to exclude from generation

### User Interface
- Clean, modern interface built with Gradio
- Dark/Light theme support
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Intuitive parameter controls with sliders and inputs
