BETTER UI/UX APPROACH FOR CONSTRAINTS

Current approach: Disabling checkboxes dynamically
Problems:
- Confusing for users (checkboxes gray out unexpectedly)
- Hard to understand WHY something is disabled
- Users can't see full feature list
- Poor discoverability

BETTER APPROACHES:

1. VALIDATION ON GENERATE (Recommended)
   - Let users select anything
   - Show friendly warning message before generation
   - Give option to auto-fix or manually adjust
   - Pros: Non-intrusive, educational, flexible
   - Cons: Validation happens late

2. LIVE WARNINGS (Subtle indicators)
   - Show warning icons/badges next to incompatible options
   - Don't disable anything
   - Use tooltips to explain
   - Pros: Informative, non-blocking
   - Cons: Users might miss warnings

3. SMART DEFAULTS + SUGGESTIONS
   - Use most common combinations as defaults
   - Show "Recommended" badge on common combos
   - Suggest alternatives when rare combo selected
   - Pros: Guides users to quality results
   - Cons: Requires more UI space

4. CONSTRAINT-FREE MODE
   - Remove all constraints
   - Let model handle rare combinations
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility
   - Cons: May produce poor results for rare combos

RECOMMENDED HYBRID APPROACH:
- Only disable the ONE true constraint: Coastal + Highway (0%)
- For very rare combos (<1%): Show warning badge with tooltip
- For rare combos (1-5%): Show info badge
- Add "Training Data Match" indicator showing % of similar images in training

1. HARD CONSTRAINT (0% occurrence):
   - Coastal + Highway: Disable checkbox with clear tooltip
   
2. SOFT WARNINGS (<1% occurrence):
   - Coastal + High Density (0.9%)
   - Coastal + Commercial (0.3%)
   - Coastal + Rural (0.9%)
   - Highway + Commercial (0.3%)
   - Commercial + Rural (0.6%)
   
   Show ⚠️ warning badge with hover tooltip:
   "This combination is very rare in training data (0.X%). 
    Results may be unpredictable. Recommended alternatives: ..."

3. INFO BADGES (1-5% occurrence):
   - Show 💡 info icon for rare but valid combinations
   - Tooltip: "Uncommon combination (X%). May work but less tested."

4. QUALITY INDICATOR:
   - Add "Training Data Coverage" meter
   - Shows % of training images matching current selection
   - Green (>10%), Yellow (1-10%), Red (<1%)
   - Helps users understand result quality before generating

5. UI COMPONENTS:
   - Remove most dynamic disabling
   - Add small badges next to checkboxes
   - Add hover tooltips with explanations
   - Add global "Configuration Quality" indicator
   - Show "Similar in Training: X images" counter
